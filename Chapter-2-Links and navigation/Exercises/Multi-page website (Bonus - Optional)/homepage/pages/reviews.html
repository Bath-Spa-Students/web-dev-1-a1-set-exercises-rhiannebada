            <p>This anime is one of the best shows I've seen, and it's honestly one of my favorites. It's such a sad yet beautiful one. I had never been so fascinated with writing letters before seeing this, and man, this show is just so good that it got me to care about letters so much and learn the impact they could have on people. It's a stunning show, the animation is excellent, and there are some amazing and beautiful shots/scenes throughout. The show is about this girl named Violet who is ex-military and after the last big battle that happened her commander told her that he “loved her” and ever since then she goes on this amazing journey trying to find out the meaning of “I love you.” With each episode, Violet grows, and her story is quite beautiful, and it's just amazing to see it all unfold. She made many friends, some who helped her on her journey, and she helped many people. The soundtrack is something else, and I listen to it all the time. I loved Luculia and Violet's friendship, and I wish we got to see more of them, maybe even working together on a project, but I’m still happy with what we got. I don't get very emotional while watching movies/shows, but this one had me tearing up quite a bit. From what I understand, the manga is pretty different from the series, but I prefer the anime for most of the changes. Anyways this is a great show, and I HIGHLY recommend it!</p>

        <p>This anime is one of the best animations I have seen as it grabs the audience from the moment they click play. It processes the elements that create a story that makes you emotional and deeply in your thoughts. Violet Evergarden, an anime series made in 2018, is an extremely beautiful and elegant motion art, it makes you inherit these types of feelings which are beyond my reach to explain. I loved the imagination this anime has brought to the viewers. The concept of the anime makes you emotionally in tears. From my experience, the animation, soundtrack, plot, characters, relationships and costume designs are so unique and sumptuous. I thank this anime for helping me expand my imagination to new areas which I never knew I could do before. It's unfortunate for the recent arson attack on Kyoto animation, however, art motion like this one will force the viewers to remember the victims who fought hard to produce an anime which has honestly saved lives, including mine, So thank you again :)</p>

        <p>Violet Evergarden is an anime series from 2018 that focuses to the titular character Violet, a war veteran who know nothing about normal life and works as a ghostwriter to find the meaning of feeling and affection which she struggles to understand. 

            This series is definitely one of the best anime drama series of all time. It's one of the few series that's able to perfectly condense a lot of it's side character development and emotional moments in nearly each of the mostly standalone episodes this series has, while slowly building up the main character development whom, by using other people thought and feelings began to understand them and herself. Soundtrack is amazing and mostly suited to the series theme and scenes, although it can be a bit repetitive at times. Graphics and animation are astonishingly beautiful, have a production quality that's on par with many anime theatrical movies, setting a high bar for other anime series to follow up on. While on the other hand character development and emotional buildup is the strong point of the series, it also serves as a minor weakness as some side character that are introduced have too little development while others properly developed and mature enough to have the audience heavily invested in their story. Overall this is a great and must to watch for everyone who love anime and drama adaptations. Beware if you are a crybaby :D</p>
